## Hi there! üëã

I'm Nick, an electronics hobbyist and simulation developer. Feel free to explore some of my repositories.

üîß Here's what I'm currently working on:
- Gesture, a Bluetooth remote which converts spatial motion into mouse and keyboard input (https://github.com/nt314p/Gesture-Remote)
- A simulation engine in OpenGL to render math and physics phenomena (https://github.com/nt314p/Simulation-Engine)
- Astronomical N-body Sim, an n-body simulation built with Unity which uses compute shaders to perform particle calculations on your GPU (https://github.com/nt314p/Astronomical-N-Body-Sim)

‚ùì  What do a photon and a lookup table have in common? They both trade time for space...
